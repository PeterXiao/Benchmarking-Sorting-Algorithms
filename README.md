# Benchmarking
Benchmarking the performance of different sorting algorithms implemented in Java

The following sorting algorithms are included in the class Benchmarking:
- **bubblesort**            Average case: **O(n^2)**  Worst case: **O(n^2)**
- **selectionsort**         Average case: **O(n^2)**  Worst case:  **O(n^2)**
- **insertionsort**         Average case: **O(n^2)**  Worst case:  **O(n^2)**
- **quicksort**             Average case: **O(n log(n))**  Worst case: **O(n^2)**
- **mergesort**             Average case: **O(n log(n))**  Worst case: **O(n log(n))**
