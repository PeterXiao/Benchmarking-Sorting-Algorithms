# Benchmarking
Benchmarking the performance of different sorting algorithms implemented in Java

The following sorting algorithms are included in the class Benchmarking:
- **bubblesort**            Average case: O(n^2)  Worst case: O(n^2)
- **selectionsort**         Average case:  Worst case:  O(n^2)
- **insertionsort**         Average case:  Worst case:  O(n^2)
- **quicksort**             Average case:  Worst case:
- **mergesort**             Average case:  Worst case:
